                        Chef Reek Ryant was raised in Philadelphia and can remember his passion developing for the culinary arts as early as 7 years old. His time at SCI Somerset is where he earned his first apprenticeship and was certified by the state of Pennsylvania as a journeyman “cook”. He later attended Community College of Philadelphia, Temple University Fox School of Business and finally the Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College earning degrees at all three universities. While still attending The Restaurant School, he interned with Jeffery Miller Catering and eventually stayed on as a party chef specializing in wedding receptions and private events. He also opened up Frankies on Fairview in Delaware County during that time.</p>
